          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            From the beginning of our project, we ensured it was grounded in
            values that go beyond technical success. We took responsibility,
            sustainability, and usability as core principles that would not only
            shape our design but also help us interact with the communities
            affected by the problem. With the widespread use of organochlorine
            pesticides (OCPs) and their persistent nature as contaminants in
            water, We Sought a solution that is both biologically informed and
            socially responsible. To understand the problem from the perspective
            of those affected, we plan to engage with stakeholders and IHP
            contacts, including environmental scientists, pesticide researchers,
            water treatment professionals, and professors who interact with
            these contaminants. These constraints helped us find where existing
            solutions fall short and clarify the practical constraints that any
            real-world technology must address. Throughout our project, we
            ensured our design was environmentally safe and user-friendly. We
            also plan to assess the potential risks of deploying biological
            systems in water treatment. Through discussions and risk
            assessments, through research papers, we developed a bio-based
            filter concept that is effective, scalable, and ethically sound. By
            viewing Human Practices not just as an add-on but as a key
            framework, we aim to improve our solution through feedback from
            relevant communities and experts. As a result, our solution is
            grounded in scientific rigor, informed by stakeholder needs, and
            aligned with the environmental and ethical expectations of
            real-world use.
          </p>
          <section id="stakeholders">
            <h2>Stakeholders</h2>

            <h3>Primary: Farmers</h3>
            <p>
              Even though many organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), such as DDT,
              HCH, endosulfan, aldrin, and dieldrin, have been banned or
              restricted, they persist and continue to be detected in irrigation
              water and groundwater in agricultural regions due to their
              long-term environmental stability and historical use. In the
              irrigation water samples collected near agricultural fields in and
              around Jaipur, OCP residues were found in open-well and tube-well
              sources, with compounds such as HCH, endosulfan, and dieldrin
              detected at concentrations ranging from 2-16 ppb (Sharma & Khan,
              2009). Similarly, monitoring of groundwater used for irrigation in
              and around Delhi revealed the presence of multiple organochlorine
              insecticides in water samples, even though levels were below WHO
              limits, indicating that these persistent pesticides enter water
              systems used for agricultural purposes (Mukherjee & Gopal, 2002).
            </p>

            <h3>Contact</h3>
            <p>
              We had an interactive session with Mr. Krishnakumar Menon, a
              farmer who maintains and cultivates his land in Varavoor, Thrissur
              district, Kerala. He mainly cultivates bananas, coconuts, arica
              nuts, and seasonal crops like turmeric. We learned about the
              application of different pesticides for different crops and about
              how agricultural regulations and rules are not uniform across
              India. He wasn't aware of OCPs, which gave us an opportunity to
              raise awareness on the issue and our proposed solution. He was
              fascinated by our solution and is looking forward to the success
              of our project.
            </p>

            <h3>Secondary: Public</h3>
            <p>
              We, as the public, are also to some extent responsible for the
              contamination of water by OCPs. The products we use, such as
              Lindane shampoo or lotion, have been used as topical treatments
              for head lice and scabies in humans. Lindane
              (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane) is an organochlorine pesticide that was
              originally developed as an agricultural insecticide and later
              adapted for medical use in shampoos and lotions (Humans, 2018;
              Nolan et al., 2012). Though their use has reduced due to safety
              concerns and regulatory restrictions, residues and outdated
              formulations can persist in supply chains, causing risks to human
              dermal and environmental exposure.
            </p>

            <h3>Form</h3>
            <p>
              Hence, we designed a Google Form to share with the community, both
              to raise awareness about our work and to understand public
              perspectives on certain aspects of our project.

              We are aware that new approaches alone cannot be effective without
              understanding their practical contexts. As we move forward with
              our project, we intend to engage with a vast range of
              stakeholders, ranging from farmers to professionals and
              professors, and so on, considering their feedback and implementing
              it to improve our project. The motive behind such interactions not
              only contributes to influencing our technical approach but also
              helps in gaining insights regarding possible limitations in
              implementation, which we may not have taken into account. By
              considering their perspectives in our project, we try to assess
              our ideas and, in turn, improve our project to make it more

              A survey was conducted as of 15 Jan 2026 (7.00 pm) to assess how
              aware people are of persistent pesticide contamination and their
              acceptance of biological remediation methods. Around 230 people
              submitted responses. The results are as follows:

              The survey shows that most of the audience have not used or worked
              with pesticides before. This shows that most of the audience are
              working individuals and students. They do have some knowledge
              about certain pesticides being banned, and that they can persist
              in soil for a long period of time. They aren't much aware of
              current techniques or solutions being used, but are very much
              interested in a solution that is biological rather than a chemical
              method, which gives us more reason to propose our solution.
