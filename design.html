          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Curli fibers are extracellular amyloid proteins naturally produced
            by E. coli that self-assemble into robust fibrous networks. Because
            curli fibers are secreted outside the cell and remain stable after
            cell lysis, they are an ideal biological scaffold for creating
            non-living, functional biomaterials. In this project, we aimed to
            engineer curli fibers to interface effectively with MXene, a
            negatively charged two-dimensional nanomaterial, and to integrate
            them into a composite filtration system for the removal of
            organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) from water.
          </p>
          <p>
            To enhance interactions between curli fibers and MXene, we
            genetically modified the major curli subunit protein CsgA by adding
            a C-terminal poly-lysine tag (K8). Lysine residues are positively
            charged at physiological pH, enabling strong electrostatic
            attraction to the negatively charged surface terminations of MXene.
          </p>
          <h2>Genetic Construct Design</h2>
          <p>
            The engineered construct was designed with the following
            architecture:
            <br />
            PcsgA → RBS → csgA → GSGSGS linker → K8 tag → BBa_B0015 terminator
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              PcsgA promoter: <br />
              The native curli promoter was used to ensure expression under
              curli-inducing conditions, maintaining physiological relevance and
              minimizing metabolic burden.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ribosome Binding Site (RBS):<br />
              A standard bacterial RBS was included to ensure efficient
              translation initiation.
            </li>
            <li>
              csgA coding sequence: <br />
              Encodes the major structural subunit of curli fibers.
            </li>
            <li>
              GSGSGS flexible linker: <br />
              A short glycine-serine-rich linker was inserted to spatially
              separate CsgA from the lysine tag, reducing steric interference
              and preserving proper curli fiber assembly.
            </li>
            <li>
              K8 poly-lysine tag: <br />
              Eight lysine residues were appended to the C-terminus of CsgA to
              enhance electrostatic binding to MXene. K8 was chosen to increase
              surface charge while minimizing risks of aggregation or secretion
              defects that can occur with longer poly-lysine sequences.
            </li>
            <li>
              BBa_B0015 terminator:<br />
              A standard double terminator was included to ensure reliable
              transcriptional termination and prevent read-through into
              downstream sequences.
            </li>
          </ul>

          </figure>
          <h3>Gibson Assembly and Transformation strategy:</h3>
          <p>
            The final engineered plasmid, pSB1C3_PcsgA_CsgA-K8, should encode a
            lysine-functionalized curli subunit that can self-assemble into
            fibers that are capable of linking with MXene. This design would
            help produce a cell-free component that can be integrated with
            chitosan and chitin into composite filtration films for
            environmental remediation. <br />
            Gibson Assemble can be used as a cloning technique here. In this
            approach, the curli expression cassette (PcsgA-csgA-K8-BBa_B0015)
            and the pSB1C3 backbone will be amplified using PCR with the help of
            primers, introducing overlapping homologous regions. These fragments
            will then be assembled in a single isothermal reaction that will
            ensure its precise and efficient construction. <br />
            Now, the recombinant plasmid can be introduced into the competent
            Escherichia coli DH5α cells via heat-shock transformation. DH5α has
            a high transformation efficiency and suitability for plasmid
            propagation and sequence verification. Positive clones will be
            identified through antibiotic selection and further confirmed by
            restriction analysis and sequencing. Then the plasmid will be
            transformed into a curli-producing E. coli K-12 strain for
            downstream curli fiber expression and other functional assays.
            <br />

          <h2>Proposed Approach Using Synthetic Biology</h2>
          <p>
            Our project employs the Biofilm-Integrated Nanofibre Display (BIND)
            strategy to engineer functional biofilm materials using the native
            curli system of Escherichia coli. BIND enables the extracellular
            display of genetically encoded peptide domains by fusing them to
            CsgA, the major structural subunit of curli amyloid fibres. Through
            this approach, biofilm formation and material functionality are
            genetically programmed at the protein level (<a

          <h3>Engineering Rationale</h3>
          <p>
            Curli fibres are extracellular amyloid nanofibres naturally produced
            by E. coli and form the structural scaffold of bacterial biofilms.
            The curli biogenesis pathway secretes unfolded CsgA monomers through
            the outer-membrane pore CsgG, where they assemble extracellularly
            into fibres nucleated by CsgB. CsgA tolerates the fusion of short,
            unstructured peptide domains without disrupting secretion or fibre
            assembly. <br /><br />
            The BIND strategy exploits this tolerance by genetically fusing
            functional peptides to CsgA, thereby enabling simultaneous fibre
            assembly and functional display within the biofilm extracellular
            matrix. <br /><br />
            This BIND-based design enables material functionality to be encoded
            directly in the genetic sequence, eliminating the need for external
            modification steps during fiber formation. By using lysine-rich
            peptide domains, we introduce tunable surface chemistry while
            preserving robust curli assembly and biofilm formation. The
            resulting system converts bacterial biofilms into living,
            self-assembling materials with genetically programmable properties
            (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5945 "
              >Nguyen et al., 2014</a
            >;
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmat3912">Chen et al., 2014</a>).
          </p>
          <h3>Mechanism of BIND in Our System:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Genetic fusion of a lysine-rich peptide domain to CsgA using a
              flexible linker.
            </li>
            <li>
              Expression of the protein and secretion through the natural curli
              export system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extracellular self-assembly of the monomers into amyloid
              nanofibres on the cell surface nucleated by CsgB.
            </li>
            <li>
              Display of the lysine-rich domains at high density on the surface
              of the fibre network and transformation of the biofilm matrix into
              a programmable material network.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            By integrating lysine-functionalized peptides into curli nanofibres
            using the BIND strategy, our engineering approach transforms E. coli
            biofilms into genetically programmable material systems. This design
            establishes a robust and modular platform for engineering
            biofilm-based functional materials.

            Filtration System for Removal of Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs)
          </h2>
          <p>
            It has a three-component structure consisting of chitosan beads,
            nanosheets of MXene materials, and curli fibers that remove
            organochlorine pesticides effectively from polluted water. The
            chitosan bead layer functions as the main medium for adsorption.
            Chitosan, which is found in chitin, has amine and hydroxyl groups,
            which allow for electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding
            between the chitosan and the hydrophobic pesticide, hence being very
            efficient in the removal of organochlorines from water
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.11.003"
              >(Lu et al., 2011)</a
            >. Chitosan powder is readily available and can be purchased from
            many sources such as IndiaMART. The beads can then be prepared in
            the lab.
            <br />
            The layer of MXene nanosheets provides a high surface secondary
            filtration and catalysis layer. Generally, MXenes possess
            hydrophilic, conductivity, and surface chemistry attributes, and
            their addition to protein matrices, as has been shown in some recent
            bioprinting studies, provides mechanical strength and antibacterial
            capability
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d4ma00112e"
              >(Garcia et al., 2024)</a
            >. The MXene can be procured from Sigma Aldrich.<br />
            The curli fiber layer, made of self-assembling bacterial amyloid
            proteins, is a nanofibrous network which increases mechanical
            filtration properties and also increases the number of binding sites
            due to amino acid functional groups. The curli fiber increases
            biofilm stability and also increases the binding of residual
            pesticide molecules and nanoparticles.<br />
            This multi-functional filtration technique combines physical sieving
            action, chemical adsorption processes, and biological/nanomaterial
            interactions in an effort to remove organochlorines from water.
            However, due to the strict regulation of OCPs (high toxicity), we
            intend to use an analog, pentachlorocyclohexane, during our testing
            process.
