          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Curli fibers are extracellular amyloid proteins naturally produced
            by E. coli that self-assemble into strong fibrous networks. Since
            these are secreted outside the cell and remain stable after cell
            lysis, they are an ideal biological scaffold. In this project, we
            aimed to engineer curli fibers to bind effectively with MXene which
            is a negatively charged two-dimensional nanomaterial, and to
            integrate them into a composite filtration system for the removal of
            organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) from water.
          </p>
          <p>
            To enhance interactions between curli fibers and MXene, we
            genetically modified the major curli subunit protein CsgA by adding
            a C-terminal poly-lysine tag (K8). Lysine residues are positively
            charged at physiological pH, enabling strong electrostatic
            attraction to the negatively charged surface terminations of MXene.

            <h2>Construct Design (pET-22b–csgA)</h2>

            <p>
              The pET-22b(+) expression vector was used to construct a plasmid
              encoding the
              <em>csgA</em> gene under the control of a T7 promoter for
              inducible expression in <em>Escherichia coli</em>. This vector was
              selected due to its strong, well-characterized T7-based expression
              system and compatibility with downstream protein purification.
            </p>

            <h3>Genetic Elements of the Construct</h3>

            <p>
              The final construct consists of the following elements in order:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                T7 Promoter:<br />
                Drives high-level transcription in <em>E. coli</em> strains
                expressing T7 RNA polymerase.
              </li>

              <li>
                Ribosome Binding Site (RBS):<br />
                Ensures efficient translation of the downstream gene.
              </li>

              <li>
                <em>csgA</em> Coding Sequence:<br />
                Encodes CsgA, the major structural subunit of curli amyloid
                fibers.
              </li>

              <li>
                C-terminal 6×His Tag:<br />
                Fused in-frame to <em>csgA</em> to enable purification via
                nickel affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA).
              </li>

              <li>
                T7 Terminator:<br />
                Signals proper termination of transcription and improves mRNA
                stability.
              </li>

              <li>
                Ampicillin Resistance Gene (AmpR):<br />
                Provides antibiotic selection to identify cells carrying the
                plasmid.
              </li>

              <li>
                ColE1 Origin of Replication:<br />
                Allows stable replication of the plasmid in <em>E. coli</em>.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Gibson Assembly Procedure for pET-22b–csgA</h3>

            <p>
              The <em>csgA</em> gene was assembled into the pET-22b(+) vector
              using Gibson Assembly. The insert was designed in Benchling with
              homologous overlaps to the vector multiple cloning site (MCS),
              ensuring correct orientation and in-frame fusion with the
              C-terminal 6×His tag.
            </p>

            <h4>Fragment Design (Benchling)</h4>

            <p>Two DNA fragments were used:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                pET-22b(+) Backbone:<br />
                The vector was linearized <em>in silico</em> at the MCS region
                and retained:
                <ul>
                  <li>T7 promoter</li>
                  <li>Ribosome binding site</li>
                  <li>C-terminal 6×His tag</li>
                  <li>T7 terminator</li>
                  <li>Ampicillin resistance gene (AmpR)</li>
                  <li>ColE1 origin of replication</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                <em>csgA</em> Insert:<br />
                The <em>csgA</em> coding sequence was PCR-amplified. Primers
                were designed in Benchling to introduce:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    5′ overlap homologous to the vector region upstream of the
                    MCS
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    3′ overlap homologous to the region immediately upstream of
                    the 6×His tag
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <figure>
              <img
                src="pet22b-csgA-sequence-1.png"
                alt="Image on BIND MECHANISM"
              />
              <figcaption class="figure">
                Figure 2: Plasmid Design (pET22b–csgA)
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              These homologous overlaps enabled seamless Gibson Assembly. To
              ensure that the
              <em>csgA</em> insert remained in-frame with the plasmid, two
              additional nucleotides (T and A) were introduced immediately after
              the MCS. This prevented a frameshift at the vector–insert junction
              and preserved the correct reading frame, allowing continuous
              translation from the upstream start codon through the
              <em>csgA</em>
              coding sequence, beginning with its N-terminal methionine.
            </p>

            <p>
              Benchling’s translation and frame visualization tools were used to
              confirm correct amino acid translation across the vector–insert
              junction.
            </p>

            <h4>In Silico Gibson Assembly</h4>

            <p>Benchling’s Gibson Assembly tool was used to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Simulate assembly of the linearized pET-22b(+) backbone with the
                PCR-amplified <em>csgA</em> insert
              </li>
              <li>Confirm correct orientation and junction sequences</li>
              <li>
                Verify that the final plasmid contained all intended genetic
                elements in the correct order
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Following <em>in silico</em> design and Gibson Assembly, the
              assembled pET-22b–<em>csgA</em> plasmid will be transformed into
              an <em>Escherichia coli</em> K-12 strain for cloning and plasmid
              propagation. K-12 strains were selected due to their genetic
              stability and lack of T7 RNA polymerase, preventing unintended
              expression of <em>csgA</em>
              during the cloning stage. Transformants will be selected on
              ampicillin-containing agar and used for downstream verification.
            </p>

          <h2>Proposed Approach Using Synthetic Biology</h2>
          <p>
            Our project uses the Biofilm-Integrated Nanofibre Display (BIND)
            strategy to engineer functional biofilm materials using the native
            curli system of Escherichia coli. BIND enables the extracellular
            display of genetically encoded peptide domains by fusing them to
            CsgA, the major structural subunit of curli amyloid fibres. Through
            this approach, biofilm formation and material functionality are
            genetically programmed at the protein level (<a

          <h3>Engineering Rationale</h3>
          <p>
            Curli fibres are extracellular amyloid nanofibres naturally produced
            by E. coli and form the structural scaffold of bacterial biofilms.
            The curli biogenesis pathway secretes unfolded CsgA monomers through
            the outer-membrane pore CsgG, where they assemble extracellularly
            into fibres nucleated by CsgB. CsgA tolerates the fusion of short,
            unstructured peptide domains without disrupting secretion or fibre
            assembly. <br /><br />
            The BIND strategy exploits this tolerance by genetically fusing
            functional peptides to CsgA, thereby enabling simultaneous fibre
            assembly and functional display within the biofilm extracellular
            matrix. <br /><br />
            This BIND-based design enables material functionality to be encoded
            directly in the genetic sequence, eliminates the need for external
            modification steps during fiber formation. A lysine-rich region
            ensures better binding and stability. The resulting system converts
            bacterial biofilms into living, self-assembling materials with
            genetically programmable properties (<a
              href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5945 "
              >Nguyen et al., 2014</a
            >;
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmat3912">Chen et al., 2014</a>).
          </p>
          <h3>Mechanism of BIND in Our System:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Genetic fusion of a lysine-rich peptide domain to CsgA using a
              flexible linker.
            </li>
            <li>
              Expression of the protein and secretion through the natural curli
              export system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extracellular self-assembly of the monomers into amyloid
              nanofibres on the cell surface nucleated by CsgB.
            </li>
            <li>
              Display of the lysine-rich domains at high density on the surface
              of the fibre network and transformation of the biofilm matrix into
              a programmable material network.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            By integrating lysine-functionalized peptides into curli nanofibres
            using the BIND strategy, our engineering approach transforms E. coli
            biofilms into genetically programmable material systems. This design
            establishes a robust and modular platform for engineering
            biofilm-based functional materials.

            Filtration System for Removal of Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs)
          </h2>
          <p>
            It has a three-component structure consisting of chitosan beads,
            nanosheets of MXene materials, and curli fibers that remove
            organochlorine pesticides effectively from polluted water. The
            chitosan bead layer functions as the main medium for adsorption.
            Chitosan, which is found in chitin, has amine and hydroxyl groups,
            which allow for electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding
            between the chitosan and the hydrophobic pesticide, hence being very
            efficient in the removal of organochlorines from water
            <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.11.003"
              >(Lu et al., 2011)</a
            >. Chitosan powder is readily available and can be purchased from
            many sources such as IndiaMART. The beads can then be prepared in
            the lab.
            <br />
            The layer of MXene nanosheets provides a high surface secondary
            filtration and catalysis layer. Generally, MXenes possess
            hydrophilic, conductivity, and surface chemistry attributes, and
            their addition to protein matrices, as has been shown in some recent

            The curli fiber layer, made of self-assembling bacterial amyloid
            proteins, is a nanofibrous network which increases mechanical
            filtration properties and also increases the number of binding sites
            due to amino acid functional groups. The curli fiber increases
            biofilm stability and also increases the binding of residual
            pesticide molecules and nanoparticles.<br />
            This multi-functional filtration technique combines physical sieving
            action, chemical adsorption processes, and biological/nanomaterial
            interactions in an effort to remove organochlorines from water.
            However, due to the strict regulation of OCPs (high toxicity), we
            intend to use an analog, pentachlorocyclohexane, during our testing
            process.
