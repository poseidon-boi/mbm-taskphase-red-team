          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            To address this challenge of OCPS, we aim to develop a localized
            filtration system designed to selectively capture and retain OCPs
            from pre-treated water.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>System Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            The hardware pruposed is a all 3D-printed, field-deployable
            filtration unit suitable for decentralized water remediation
            applications. Let’s talk about the main structure. The whole filter
            body is made from PETG, or Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol .
            PETG’s a solid choice as it holds up after lots of use, doesn’t
            react with water, and doesn’t soak up oily stuff the way some
            plastics do. Plus, it’s easy to print with, so making replacement
            parts or new filters is pretty simple.
          </p>

          <p>The system architecture includes:</p>
          <h4>Inlet</h4>
          <p>
            The inlet is placed vertically, which directs the incoming
            pre-treated water into the filtration module with minimal turbulence
            of an ideal flow of 0.1 to 0.5L/min and ensures uniform distribution
            of flow across the active filter surface.
          </p>

          <h4>Half‑Trapezium Shaped Filter Mesh (Active Zone)</h4>
          <p>
            The geometry plays a critical role in the filter’s performance by
            governing internal flow behavior. As organochlorine pesticides
            (OCPs) are hydrophobic in nature, they tend to adhere to flat walls,
            which means a flat horizontal filter mesh or the adsorption material
            on the side walls will not be efficient enough to remove the OCPs in
            water. To counter this problem, we have used a half-trapezium
            geometry that disrupts boundary-layer formation and redirects flow
            toward the mesh surface, ensuring repeated contact with the active
            zone while minimizing unwanted wall adsorption.
          </p>
          <h4>Mesh Composition</h4>
          <h5>PETG–PDA–CNF Filter Design</h5>
          <p>
            In this filter, we only functionalize the active mesh area-the side
            walls stay plain PETG. That way, fibers don’t overlap with the walls
            and mess up the structure.To make the surface treatment last, we
            coat the PETG mesh with polydopamine (PDA). It’s a simple process:
            just soak the mesh in a slightly basic dopamine solution. The PDA
            forms a thin, even layer that sticks well, holds onto later
            coatings, and doesn’t block the pores. Next, we dip-coat this PDA
            layer with a dilute cellulose nanofiber (CNF) dispersion, then let
            it dry gently. CNF works better than bacterial cellulose here
            because it forms a thin, porous, and uniform coating-no need for
            cutting or extra shaping. This CNF layer gives the filter a
            high-surface-area, water-loving interface that still lets water pass
            through easily. By layering like this, we separate the roles: PETG
            gives the structure, PDA keeps the coatings in place, and CNF
            handles filtration. The result is a filter that holds up for weeks
            in pre-treated water (pH 6–8.5) without falling apart.
          </p>

          <h5>Curli Immobilization on CNF-Functionalized Mesh</h5>
          <p>
            We produce curli fibers separately and mix them with Chitosan beads
            and MXene, and then attach them to the CNF-coated PETG mesh. The
            process is pretty straightforward: hydrate the mesh, soak it in a
            curli suspension for a bit, and let the curli naturally grab onto
            the cellulose surface. Afterward, we rinse off anything that didn’t
            stick. What’s left is a stable layer of curli fibers locked onto the
            CNF. No need for harsh chemicals or extra steps. Curli just has a
            natural pull to cellulose. The binding happens only on the CNF
            surface, so the rest of the mesh-the PETG–PDA–CNF layers-stay
            untouched. That keeps the pores open and the water flowing, while
            the curli layer adds some biological action.
          </p>

          <h5>Capture Mechanism</h5>
          <p>
            Hydrodynamic flow inside the filter keeps organic micropollutants
            (OCPs) from settling on the walls. OCPs present in the water stick
            to the CNF–curli–chitosan surface. Hydrophobic interactions take
            over, so the OCPs get adsorbed and stay put.
          </p>

          <h4>Sloped Base  </h4>
          <p>
            The base slopes gently-just 10 degrees. That’s enough to keep water
            from pooling up and causing problems.
          </p>

          <h4>Outlet</h4>
          <p>
            After water moves through the mesh and down the slope, it heads for
            the outlet. The outlet grabs the filtered water, keeps particles
            from sneaking back in, and makes sure the flow stays steady.
          </p>

          <h4>Differential Pressure Sensor </h4>
          <p>
            There's one differential pressure sensor set up across the active
            mesh. It keeps an eye on the pressure drop in real time. That way,
            you know right away if contaminants break through or when the
            media’s almost used up.
          </p>
          <p>ΔP = P inlet − P outlet</p>

          <h2>Hardware DBTL Summary – OCP Filtration System</h2>
          <h3>Design 1 : Vertical Mesh Concept</h3>
          <p>
            We started out by putting up a vertical filter mesh (pretty much the
            usual approach), pulled straight from membrane filtration basics.
            The material? PES–cellulose blends. But OCPs had other plans.
            They're incredibly hydrophobic, so instead of sticking to the mesh,
            they clung to the chamber walls. That built up stubborn boundary
            layers, and fouling got out of hand fast, including the fact that we
            will need to put additional flow sensors and pumps to maintain the
            water flows throughout the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, just picking a different material didn’t fix things. Turns out,
            how the water moves is just as important as what the filter’s made
            of if you actually want to catch OCPs.
          </p>

          <h3>Design 2: Horizontal Mesh & Early 3D Printing</h3>
          <p>
            Next, we tried flipping the mesh to a horizontal setup, thinking it
            might help with the hydraulic flow maintenance part, since in this
            we were keeping the inlet on the top and outlet at the bottom, so
            gravity would be enough to ensure water is flowing through the
            filter. We also used PLA so we could 3D print prototypes quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            That plan fell apart. PLA can’t really handle water after a while,
            it starts to degrade. And those hydrophobic OCPs? Still glued
            themselves to the chamber walls. Switching mesh direction didn’t do
            the trick.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bottom line: We needed something tougher and more water-resistant,
            and a design that forced water-plus those OCPs-off the walls. Just
            turning the mesh wasn’t enough.
          </p>

            alt="Horizontal mesh filtration prototype"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Design 2: Horizontal PETG mesh configuration tested to improve
            gravity-driven flow. Hydrophobic OCPs accumulated along chamber
            walls, resulting in fouling.
          </figcaption>

          <h3>Final Design: Trapezium Mesh with PETG Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            So, for the final round, we went with a half-trapezium mesh made
            from PETG, built the whole thing out of PETG, and then added some
            smart coatings and layers-PDA, cellulose nanofibers, curli, and a
            mix of adsorption materials-right where they’d actually make a
            difference.
          </p>

          <p>What changed?</p>
          <p>
            PETG holds up against water and chemicals, no problem. The new
            trapezium shape messes with the boundary layer and pushes water away
            from the walls. It also has not-so-pointed edges so that make sure
            there is no unwanted accumulation or overlapping of the curli fibers
            we are using. All the functional layers keep fouling under control.
            A sloped base and pressure sensors make it easy to watch what’s
            going on.
          </p>
          <p>The result?</p>
          <p>
            We finally got the materials and water flow working together. OCPs
            don’t just build up anywhere-they land exactly where we want, right
            in the active zone, so swapping out the filter is easy.
