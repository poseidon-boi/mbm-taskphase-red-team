            <li>
              UV Filter Degradation and Immobilization: Filtration/ Degradation
              of UV filters (octocrylene, oxybenzone) by engineered laccase was
              investigated, with the type of laccases produced in different
              organisms. Immobilization of sodium alginate beads has been

              enzymes as artificial additives; reviewed precedents from iGEM
              (Macquarie 2024, Sorbonne-U-Paris 2024). Abandoned because there
              were too many engineered parts.Explored microorganisms engineered
              to produce proteins/antioxidants from food waste; studied fungal
              single-cell protein production (up to 70% yield).Discontinued;
