          <p>Specific Tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Organochlorine Pesticide (OCP) Filtration (Hardware): Worked on
              the end-to-end design of a localized OCP filtration system,
              covering both hardware and software components. Framed the
              contamination problem from a hydrodynamic and
              materials-compatibility perspective, addressing hydrophobic wall
              adsorption through geometry-controlled flow and a modular
              PETG-based filter architecture. Designed and integrated a
              bio-inspired active filtration zone and implemented sensor-based
              monitoring logic to enable real-time assessment of filter
              performance under continuous operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Desalination / Water Treatment (Concept & Research): Explored
              protein-based desalination concepts using ELPs and zwitterionic
              motifs; evaluated stability under high salinity and scoped hybrid,
              short-term treatment systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Climate Resilience & Early-Warning Systems (Concept): Framed flood
              and landslide risk in coastal Karnataka as a pre-failure sensing
              problem; explored contained bio-electronic early-warning concepts.
            </li>

          <p>Specific Tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Organochlorine pesticides: Helped with most of the research work
              and helped in Conceptualization and finding relevant papers to
              arising questions. Worked on finding relevant research to prove
              that curli fibers can be used for filtration by looking at their
              application in similar filtration units, such as the extraction of
              heavy metals. Proposed the analogue to be used (PCCH) instead of
              OCPs. Worked on the HP, IHP sections on the wiki and interacted
              with a stakeholder. Found the Measurement that we could use to
              detect our mechanism (HS-SPME/DI-SPME), which will help in the
              experimental results, and also created the sections Measurement
              and lab safety on the wiki. Helped in proofreading relevant
              research papers shared by my teammates to get answers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bio cement: Worked on the entire idea from scratch. Worked on the
              problem statement, impact, existing solutions, and proposed
              solution of using peptide-based self-healing methods. Did
              background research on Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation
              (MICP) and also the factors that would influence it. Looked for
              ways to enhance the solution by making the system Cell-free and
              repeatable. Listed all the Medal criteria it would satisfy and
              what special prizes it could be eligible for. Created a
              presentation and pitched the entire project to seniors, and tried
              to find answers to the challenges and problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bracken Fern: Was involved and helpful throughout the project by
              raising questions that helped in the conceptualization aspects of
              the project. Also sent emails to approach potential IHP targets.

          <ul>
            <li>
              UV Filter Degradation and Immobilization: Filtration/ Degradation
              of UV filters (octocrylene, oxybenzone) by engineered laccase was
              investigated, with the type of laccases produced in different
              organisms. Immobilization of sodium alginate beads has been
              tested, laccase does not break down the beads, compatible as
              immobilization matrix. Identified possible future solutions for
              toxic ozonation byproducts. Chose to stop because of a superior
              existing solution (ozonation).
            </li>
            <li>
              Engineered Microbes for Flavor, Color, and Waste Optimization:
              Spoke with a professor of food biotech about issues in the
              industry. Explored engineering yeast to produce colorants and
              enzymes as artificial additives; reviewed precedents from iGEM
              (Macquarie 2024, Sorbonne-U-Paris 2024). Abandoned because there
              were too many engineered parts.Explored microorganisms engineered
              to produce proteins/antioxidants from food waste; studied fungal
              single-cell protein production (up to 70% yield).Discontinued;
              pathway/optimization not feasible within timeline.

              art through engineered biofilms; examined iGEM teams
              (Micro-murals, Echromi). - Discontinued; art-related applications
              were not sufficient for the scope of synthetic biology.
            </li>
            <li>
              Organochlorine pesticides: Studied binding of cyclodextrin with
              organochlorine pesticides; abandoned because a better alternative
