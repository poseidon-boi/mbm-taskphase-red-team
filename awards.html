            <h3>Best Measurement</h3>
            <p>
              We are interested in the Best Measurement award because our
              project relies on well-defined, quantitative methods to assess the
              performance of our filtration system. Each component of the filter
              is evaluated using reproducible experimental protocols, allowing
              us to measure adsorption efficiency, flow behavior, and material
              stability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our experimental design emphasizes calibration, documentation, and
              transparency so that other teams can replicate our measurements or
              adapt them to their own systems. By maintaining consistent
              standards across experiments, we ensure that our results are
              reliable, comparable, and meaningful.
            </p>

            <h3>Best Education</h3>
            <p>
              We are applying for the Best Education award because our outreach
              activities combine scientific accuracy with creativity to make
              synthetic biology approachable and engaging. Our project
              emphasizes the connection between biology, technology, and
              everyday life, helping the public understand how engineered
              biological systems can address real-world environmental
              challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              By presenting our work in an accessible and relatable manner, we
              aim to foster curiosity, awareness, and informed discussion around
              synthetic biology and its role in sustainable development.

            <h3>Best Entrepreneurship</h3>
            <p>
              We are nominating our project for the Best Entrepreneurship award
              because it extends beyond technical feasibility to address
              real-world adoption and commercialization. Our team has identified
              potential stakeholders, including sewage treatment plants and
              water authorities, and evaluated how our filtration system could
              integrate into existing infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have examined the scalability of our design by considering
              material lifetime, performance under continuous flow conditions,
              and long-term usability. This analysis enables us to assess both
              economic viability and practical deployment.
            </p>

          <section id="best-hardware">
            <h3>Best Hardware</h3>
            <p>
              We are applying for the Best Hardware award because we designed a
              bio-derived, modular adsorption filtration system that integrates
              synthetic biology components into an environmentally relevant
              application. The modular design allows individual components to be
              tested, replaced, or upgraded without redesigning the entire
              system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our hardware enables proof-of-concept testing for flow dynamics,
              material stability, and adsorption performance. We will provide
              detailed design documentation, schematics, and assembly guides so
              that future teams can reproduce and build upon our system.
            </p>

          <section id="best-software-tool">
            <h3>Best Software Tool</h3>
            <p>
              We are striving for the Best Software Tool award because we aim to
              develop a software platform that enables users to explore and
              apply curli fibers for diverse applications. This tool extends the
              impact of our project beyond organochlorine pesticide removal by
              allowing others to adapt curli-based materials for different
              functional needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              By making this software accessible and adaptable, we support
              broader innovation and reuse of synthetic biology tools within and
              beyond the iGEM community.

            <h3>Best Sustainable Development Impact</h3>
            <p>
              We are applying for the Best Sustainable Development Impact award
              because our project directly addresses multiple United Nations
              Sustainable Development Goals, including clean water and
              environmental protection. Our filtration system targets persistent
              environmental pollutants that are not effectively removed by
              conventional methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              We present our sustainability analysis in a transferable manner so
              that other iGEM teams can adapt our approach to address
              region-specific environmental challenges. This ensures that our
              work contributes to long-term, scalable environmental impact.
